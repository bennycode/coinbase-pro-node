[Coinbase Pro][1] API for Node.js, written in TypeScript and covered by tests.

## Motivation

The purpose of [coinbase-pro-node][5] is to continue an active **Coinbase Pro API** after Coinbase deprecated the official Node.js library on [January, 16 2020](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-pro-node/issues/393#issuecomment-574993096). Its predecessor got deprecated on [July, 19th 2016](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-exchange-node/commit/b8347efdb4e2589367c1395b646d283c9c391681).

## Features

- **Typed.** Source code is 100% TypeScript. No need to install external typings.
- **Tested.** Code coverage is 100%. No surprises when using "coinbase-pro-node".
- **Convenient.** Request throttling is built-in. Don't worry about rate limiting.
- **Comfortable.** More than an API client. You will get extras like [candle watching](https://github.com/bennycode/coinbase-pro-node/blob/main/src/demo/rest-watch-candles.ts).
- **Maintained.** Automated security updates. No threats from outdated dependencies.
- **Documented.** Get started with [demo scripts][3] and [generated documentation][4].
- **Modern.** HTTP client with Promise API. Don't lose yourself in callback hell.
- **Robust.** WebSocket reconnection is built-in. No problems if your Wi-Fi is gone.
- **Reliable.** Following [semantic versioning][8]. Get notified about breaking changes.

## Installation

**npm**

```bash
npm install coinbase-pro-node
```

**Yarn**

```bash
yarn add coinbase-pro-node
```

## Setup

**JavaScript**

```javascript
const {CoinbasePro} = require('coinbase-pro-node');
const client = new CoinbasePro();
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import {CoinbasePro} from 'coinbase-pro-node';
const client = new CoinbasePro();
```

## Usage

The [demo section][3] provides many examples on how to use "coinbase-pro-node". There is also an automatically generated [API documentation][4]. For a quick start, here is a simple example for a REST request:

### REST example

```typescript
import {CoinbasePro} from 'coinbase-pro-node';

// API Keys can be generated here:
// https://pro.coinbase.com/profile/api
// https://public.sandbox.pro.coinbase.com/profile/api
const auth = {
  apiKey: '',
  apiSecret: '',
  passphrase: '',
  // The Sandbox is for testing only and offers a subset of the products/assets:
  // https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#sandbox
  useSandbox: true,
};

const client = new CoinbasePro(auth);

client.rest.account.listAccounts().then(accounts => {
  const message = `You can trade "${accounts.length}" different pairs.`;
  console.log(message);
});
```

### WebSocket example

If you want to listen to WebSocket messages, have a look at these demo scripts:

- [Subscribe to "ticker" channel (real-time price updates)](https://github.com/bennycode/coinbase-pro-node/blob/main/src/demo/websocket-ticker.ts)
- [Subscribe to authenticated "user" channel](https://github.com/bennycode/coinbase-pro-node/blob/main/src/demo/websocket-user.ts)

### Demos

All [demo scripts][3] are executable from the root directory. If you want to use specific credentials with a demo script, simply add a `.env` file to the root of this package to [modify environment variables](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/tree/v8.2.0#usage) used in [init-client.ts](https://github.com/bennyn/coinbase-pro-node/blob/main/src/demo/init-client.ts).

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/demo/dump-candles.ts
```

**Tip:** There is a [.env.defaults](https://github.com/bennycode/coinbase-pro-node/blob/main/.env.defaults) file which serves as a template. Just remove its `.defaults` extension and enter your credentials to get started. Do not commit this file (or your credentials) to any repository!

### Web Frontend Applications

The "coinbase-pro-node" library was built to be used in Node.js environments BUT you can also make use of it in web frontend applications (using React, Vue.js, etc.). However, due to the [CORS restrictions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) of modern web browser, you will have to use a proxy server.

A proxy server can be setup with webpack's [DevServer proxy configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverproxy) or [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware).

Here is an example:

**Backend**

```typescript
import {createProxyMiddleware} from 'http-proxy-middleware';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use(
  '/api-coinbase-pro',
  createProxyMiddleware({
    target: 'https://api.pro.coinbase.com',
    changeOrigin: true,
    pathRewrite: {
      [`^/api-coinbase-pro`]: '',
    },
  })
);
```

Later on, you can use the proxy URL (`/api-coinbase-pro` from above) in your web application to initialize "coinbase-pro-node" with it:

**Frontend**

```typescript
const client = new CoinbasePro({
  httpUrl: '/api-coinbase-pro',
  apiKey: '',
  apiSecret: '',
  passphrase: '',
  useSandbox: false,
});
```
